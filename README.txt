Here you will find installers for Python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9.2a0.  First
double-click on the Python installer and follow the instructions given,
then double-click on the Pygame installer and follow the instructions
given.  If you update Pacewar in the future, you can just download the
plain source code distribution; reinstalling Python and Pygame will not
be necessary.

Please note that this 32-bit version of Pygame MUST be used with a
32-bit version of Python 2.7.  It is not compatible with the 64-bit
version of Python.  If your system already has the 64-bit version of
Python 2.7 installed, there are a few options:

1. Remove your 64-bit Python 2.7 installation and replace it with the
   32-bit version.  This is the easiest way, but if your 64-bit Python
   2.7 installation was being used for something else, you may have to
   reinstall some libraries.

2. Install the 32-bit version of Python 2.7 alongside your existing
   64-bit Python 2.7 installation, leaving the 64-bit Python associated
   with Python scripts, and create a shortcut which runs Pacewar with
   the 32-bit Python.  For example, if you install the 32-bit version of
   Python 2.7 in "C:\Python27-32", you can set the starting location of
   the shortcut to the Pacewar directory, and set the command to the
   following:

   C:\Python27-32\python.exe pacewar.py

   This option avoids touching the existing Python installation, but
   it's a little dirty and has the potential to unnecessarily complicate
   things in the future.

3. Download and install Pygame for the 64-bit version of Python 2.7.
   Such a build of Pygame can be found here:

   http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

   This is the cleanest way.  Unfortunately, this build of Pygame is
   only available as a wheel, so you will need to install it with pip
   from the Command Prompt.  This may be difficult if you don't know
   what you're doing.  The appropriate documentation for doing so can be
   found here:
